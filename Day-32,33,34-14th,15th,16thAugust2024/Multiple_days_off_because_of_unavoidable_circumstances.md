# Crack Your Placement 45 Days DSA Challenge Progress Update

### ðŸŒŸ Status Update:

Dear friends and supporters,

I wanted to take a moment to update you on my progress. Due to unavoidable circumstances, I had to take few days off from the challenge. Life sometimes throws unexpected events our way, and itâ€™s important to handle them as they come. 

I was busy with Flipkart Grid 6.0, Walmart Sparkathon, Hack4Change Charcha, SIH Internal Hackathon, etc.,
Eventhough many of them I failed too. I am trying my best with optimism.

However, I'm excited to share that I am back on track and ready to continue with renewed energy and determination! Hereâ€™s to resuming the journey and making even more progress from today onwards.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support!

Best regards,  
Arun Pranav A T
