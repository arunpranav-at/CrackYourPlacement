Dear friends and supporters,

I wanted to take a moment to update you on my progress. Due to unavoidable circumstances, I had to take a day off from the challenge. Life sometimes throws unexpected events our way, and it’s important to handle them as they come.

However, I'm excited to share that I am back on track and ready to continue with renewed energy and determination! Here’s to resuming the journey and making even more progress from today onwards.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support!

Best regards,  
Arun Pranav A T
